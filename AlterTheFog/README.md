# AlterTheFog

Did you overestimate the dark fog? Wish you could ramp up the difficulty? With this mod you can modify the dark fogs' settings for an existing save.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run the game once with mod installed to get the config file generated.
2. Tweak the config to your liking.
3. Load your save (make a backup beforehand just in case).
4. Save the game and reload it, you should now have the updated dark fog settings

### Does this affect metadata and/or achievements?

Currently if you upgrade / downgrade the settings for the dark fog, it does NOT update the metadata multiplier (not sure how to tweak that). Also, I am not sure if this disables achievements.

### Why not make a ingame UI to change settings on the fly?

I don't know how to create Unity UIs (never used unity and not familiar enough with C#), though the way the mod works right now you would still have to save and reload to see the changes because I also don't know how to edit the current game instance combat settings live.
